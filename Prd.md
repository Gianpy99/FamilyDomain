# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Name:** Family Domain & Shared Cloud Hub  
**Owner:** Solo build (you)  
**Date:** 2025-08-14  

---

## 1) Problem Statement
Families often have multiple digital accounts, photos, documents, and notes scattered across platforms. Coordinating shared access and maintaining privacy can be challenging. There is a need for a centralized, private family domain to manage resources, communication, and collaboration safely.

---

## 2) Goals & Objectives
- **Centralize family digital presence** under a custom domain.  
- **Provide secure shared storage** for photos, documents, and media.  
- **Enable family communication** via messages or notifications.  
- **Support task & event management** for family activities.  
- **Allow controlled access** for family members, optionally guests.  

---

## 3) Target Users
- Nuclear or extended families wanting private, centralized digital space.  
- Parents looking to share photos, events, and documents with children safely.  
- Families who want simplified domain-based identity and communication management.

## 4) Core Features

### MVP
1. **Custom Domain Setup:** Host family site and services under a personalized domain.  
2. **User Management:** Add/remove family members, assign roles, set access rights.  
3. **Shared Storage:** Upload/download photos, documents, and media with folder structure.  
4. **Basic Messaging/Notifications:** Internal messaging system for family communication.  
5. **Event/Task Calendar:** Simple calendar to manage family events and tasks.  

### Phase 2
6. **Media Gallery:** Automatically organize photos/videos, optional AI tagging.  
7. **Private Wiki/Notes:** Shared family knowledge base or notebook.  
8. **Guest Access:** Temporary, limited access for relatives or friends.  

### Phase 3
9. **Cloud Sync Across Devices:** Sync files and notes automatically on all family devices.  
10. **AI Assistance:** Suggestions for event reminders, photo tagging, and task prioritization.  
11. **Data Analytics & Backup:** Usage insights and automated backups.

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption for files and messages; strong access control.  
- **Performance:** Quick upload/download of files; low latency for messaging.  
- **Reliability:** Redundant backups and uptime >99%.  
- **Usability:** Simple interface suitable for all family members, including children.  

---

## 6) Constraints
- Limited by family members’ technical proficiency.  
- Storage costs if using cloud providers; consider hybrid local/cloud storage.  
- Domain management requires DNS setup and SSL certificates.  

---

## 7) Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js for responsive UI.  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Django) for API and auth.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite for structured data; S3-compatible storage for files.  
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 + JWT for secure login; optional 2FA.  
- **Domain Hosting:** Custom domain with SSL (Cloudflare, AWS, or Namecheap).  
- **AI:** Lightweight on-device ML or cloud API for photo tagging and event suggestions.

---

## 8) Success Metrics
- ≥90% of family members actively use the hub within first month.  
- ≤1% unauthorized access attempts.  
- High user satisfaction with navigation and storage features (>4/5).  
- File upload/download speed acceptable for typical family usage (<5 sec per MB).

## 9) Roadmap

| Phase     | Duration  | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **MVP**   | 4–6 weeks | Custom domain, user management, shared storage, messaging, calendar |
| **Phase 2** | +4 weeks | Media gallery, private notes, guest access |
| **Phase 3** | +6 weeks | Cloud sync, AI assistance, analytics & backup |

---

## 10) Risks & Mitigation
- **Privacy breaches:** End-to-end encryption, strict role management.  
- **Technical complexity for users:** Provide step-by-step onboarding and guides.  
- **Storage limitations:** Offer scalable cloud storage with alerts for nearing limits.  

---

## 11) Open Questions
- Should the hub support **external integrations** (Google Drive, iCloud)?  
- What is the maximum number of **simultaneous users** expected at launch?  
- Should there be **mobile apps** or just a web interface initially?
